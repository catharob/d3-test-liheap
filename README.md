## Playing with d3.js using data about energy assistance

This chart uses data about how states divvy up [federal funding for energy assistance](https://liheapch.acf.hhs.gov/tables/FY2016/components.htm). 

Featuring:
* Legend
* Tooltip (using [d3.tip plugin](https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip) with comments from original government dataset (lightly edited for space and clarity)
* In-script data reference (instead of CSV)

The `data.csv` file looks slightly different from data referenced in script. This is only in the addition of the full state names for alphabetization and tooltip purposes, and comments, also for tooltip.
