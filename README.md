## Playing with d3.js using data about energy assistance

This chart uses data about how states divvy up [federal funding for energy assistance](https://liheapch.acf.hhs.gov/tables/FY2016/components.htm). 

Things that will change soon:
* States will be on vertical axis, and bars will be oriented horizontally.
* Possibly, legend will show which colors for which kind of assistance. Right now orange = heat, blue = cooling, red = crisis and green = weatherization.
* Tooltip if I can figure out how.
